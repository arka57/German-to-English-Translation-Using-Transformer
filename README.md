A Seq2Seq german to english translation using Transformer

Using vanilla transformer a seq2seq german to english translator was developed using inbuilt transfomer module of nn.Transformer(
).

# Dataset
Used Multi30k dataset for model training. It contains german sentences and its corresponding english sentences

# Prerequisites
Install the required pip packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


# Training

The model was trained on the above dataset for 500 epochs using Colab GPU<br>

**Steps:**
